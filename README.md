# Get Set Go Search Engine

GSG gives you very smooth and friendly envirnment for searching.

## Idea Behind It

To create search engine that will give you best possible results in minimum typing with optimal time.

## Implementation

-> Fetching data from given JSON File.

-> Taking input from users according to their demand.

-> Manage data in state according to the input of user.

-> Pass that managed data to different components using props to show first 8 possible results and number of possible results.

-> Add option to toggle between all remaining possible results.

-> When you click on particular link you will move to your desire site/page.

## HOW TO SET UP LOCALLY  

**1.** Start by making a fork the [**Search-engine**](https://github.com/Jai-Marothiya/Search-engine) repository. Click on the <a href="https://github.com/Jai-Marothiya/Search-engine/fork"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/G4z1kEe.png" height="21" width="21"></a> symbol at the top right corner.

**2.** Clone your new fork of the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Search-engine
```

**3.** Install node modules by run below command:

```bash
npm install
```

**4.** Run code locally by using :

```bash
npm run start
```


## HOW TO START NEW REACT APP

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
